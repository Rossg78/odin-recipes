Reduce heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer for 30 minutes.</li>

    
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Add the spaghetti and olive oil to the pot and cook the pasta at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Top with the Bolognese sauce to serve.</li>
